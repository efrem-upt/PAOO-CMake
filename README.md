# PAOO-CMake
Object-Oriented Software Development in C++ with CMake. This repository is exclusively for my college laboratory titled "PAOO (Proiectarea Aplicatiilor Orientate pe Obiecte)" from Polytechnic University of Timi»ôoara (UPT).

## About this repository

This repository contains source code examples for the CMake Tutorial (https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/guide/tutorial/index.html). Each step has its own subdirectory containing code that may be used as a starting point. The tutorial examples are progressive so that each step provides the complete solution for the previous step.

## Scope of repository

The scope of this repository is to showcase my work to my laboratory assistant and to view my progress in C++ software development and CMake. However, anyone may view my progress and work and use it for their learning path.
